A basic small JSON java library with focus on reading and writing JSON, not on serializing to/from Java beans even if there is primitive support for that too.

This is something I did a very long time ago and I believed that I was no longer using this, but it urned out that MarkDownDoc actually uses this! 
So for now I'm restoring it. I did find it on an old disk :-).
